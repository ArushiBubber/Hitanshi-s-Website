      <p > Hello! I am Hitanshi Bansal. My favourite hobby is reading and i mostly do reading on night i want to read in peace and silence and felt very comfortable.
        It is nice reading book your vocabulary improves  there is a lot of books harry potter, germino silton etc. but the thing is I love to read wimpy kid so ya  i love how funny it is i did not knew how to read books  like i knew how to read but you know when my brother told me  you need to read series-wise so that when i started reading series-wise , i do not know what is in this book that i cannot stop reading! i have read the 4-5 series which i have read 7 times each it is soo intreseting it feels so nice , after finish all series of this book i am going to start reading some new book ! and  i do not know  why i do not like studying that much i just get confused even in school we do reading and in home i do the same thing but  storybook. if i keep reading and collecting books I think i am going to need a big rack to keep my books . Thank You!</p> </section>
